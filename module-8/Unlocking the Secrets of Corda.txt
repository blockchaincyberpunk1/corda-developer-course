Start with the Abstract: Begin by reading the abstract or executive summary of the whitepaper. This section provides a high-level overview of the document's key points.

Focus on Sections of Interest: You don't have to read a whitepaper cover to cover in one sitting. Instead, focus on sections that align with your interests or the specific aspects of Corda you want to learn more about.
