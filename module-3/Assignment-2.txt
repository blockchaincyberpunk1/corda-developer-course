Corda Network Deployment

Objective: Explore Corda's network deployment options.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will delve into the deployment choices available for Corda networks. The objective is to help students understand the various deployment options, including setting up a local development network, joining an existing network, or creating a new network. Students should describe the advantages and use cases for each deployment option to gain insights into when and why each option is chosen in Corda development.

Instructions:

Introduction to Corda Network Deployment:

Provide students with an introduction to the importance of network deployment in Corda development. Explain that the choice of deployment can significantly impact the development and operation of Corda applications.
Types of Corda Network Deployment:

Instruct students to research and describe the different types of Corda network deployments, including:
Setting up a local development network
Joining an existing Corda network
Creating a new Corda network
Advantages of Each Deployment Option:

Ask students to identify and explain the advantages of each deployment option. For example, what are the benefits of setting up a local development network for testing and debugging? When is joining an existing network a more practical choice, and what are the advantages of creating a new network?
Use Cases and Scenarios:

Encourage students to provide real-world use cases and scenarios where each deployment option is suitable. For instance, they can discuss how setting up a local network is beneficial during the development phase, or when joining an existing network makes sense for cross-industry collaboration.
Comparative Analysis:

Instruct students to create a comparative analysis chart or presentation that highlights the differences and similarities between the deployment options. This can help visualize the decision-making process.
Presentation or Report:

Students can choose to present their findings in a presentation format or compile them into a report. Ensure that they include clear explanations and, if applicable, visuals for the comparative analysis.
Discussion:

After completing their assignment, facilitate a class discussion where students can share their research findings and insights. Encourage peer-to-peer discussions on deployment choices.
Submission:

Students should submit their presentation slides or the report containing their research and analysis.
Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Comprehensive description of Corda network deployment options.
Clear explanation of the advantages of each deployment option.
Well-documented use cases and scenarios.
Effective comparative analysis of deployment choices.
Successful presentation or report that communicates findings clearly.
Active participation in the class discussion and engagement with peers.
Overall quality of the assignment and adherence to submission guidelines.
