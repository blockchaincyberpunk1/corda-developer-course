Troubleshooting and Debugging in Corda Development

Objective: Familiarize students with troubleshooting and debugging techniques in Corda development.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will focus on troubleshooting and debugging techniques in Corda development. The objective is to help students gain practical experience in diagnosing and resolving common issues or errors that developers may encounter during Corda application development. Students will simulate these issues and demonstrate how to use debugging tools and techniques to identify and resolve them. The assignment should also provide a summary of the debugging process, highlighting best practices.

Instructions:

Introduction to Troubleshooting and Debugging in Corda:

Provide students with an introduction to the importance of troubleshooting and debugging in Corda development. Explain that these skills are essential for identifying and resolving issues that can arise during application development.
Simulate Common Issues:

Instruct students to simulate common issues or errors that developers may encounter in Corda application development. Examples of issues include contract validation errors, flow failures, or state inconsistencies.
Diagnose and Resolve Issues:

Guide students through the process of diagnosing and resolving the simulated issues. They should demonstrate how to use debugging tools and techniques, such as logging, to identify the root causes of the problems.
