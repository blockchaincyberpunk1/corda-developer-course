Corda Node Interaction

Objective: Investigate how Corda nodes interact with each other through flows, messages, and data exchange.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will explore how Corda nodes interact with each other in the context of Corda applications. The objective is for students to choose a scenario where two or more Corda nodes need to collaborate and exchange data to achieve a common goal. They will describe the message exchange and data flow between these nodes and use diagrams or flowcharts to visualize the interactions and data exchange process.

Instructions:

Introduction to Corda Node Interaction:

Provide students with an introduction to the concept of Corda node interaction. Emphasize that Corda nodes collaborate to execute various processes on the Corda network.
Select a Collaboration Scenario:

Instruct students to choose a specific scenario or use case that involves collaboration between two or more Corda nodes. The scenario should be suitable for illustrating message exchange and data flow.
Node Interaction Description:

Ask students to describe how the chosen Corda nodes interact with each other to achieve a common goal. They should explain the steps involved, the messages exchanged, and the data flow between the nodes.
Visualize Interactions:

Encourage students to create diagrams, flowcharts, or visual representations that illustrate the interaction process between Corda nodes. These visuals should clearly depict the sequence of actions and data exchange.
Message Formats and Data Structures:

Have students outline the message formats and data structures used in the communication between Corda nodes. Explain how these messages carry out the intended actions.
Documentation and Reporting:

Instruct students to document their findings and visual representations in a report format. The report should include explanations, diagrams, and any relevant annotations.
Discussion:

Facilitate a class discussion where students can share their chosen collaboration scenarios, interaction descriptions, and visual representations. Encourage discussions on the significance of Corda node interactions in real-world applications.
Submission:

Students should submit their report, which includes their descriptions, visual representations, and explanations of Corda node interactions.
Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Clear selection of a collaboration scenario involving Corda nodes.
Detailed description of how Corda nodes interact, including message exchange and data flow.
Visual representations (diagrams or flowcharts) that effectively illustrate the interaction process.
Clarity and accuracy of documentation and reporting.
Overall quality of the assignment and adherence to submission guidelines.
