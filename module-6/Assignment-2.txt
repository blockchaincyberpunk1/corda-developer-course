Corda Network Setup

Objective: Explore the process of setting up a Corda network.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will gain hands-on experience in setting up a Corda network. The objective is to familiarize students with the steps and considerations involved in configuring a Corda network for different deployment scenarios, such as a local development network, consortium network, or a public Corda network.

Instructions:

Choose a Deployment Scenario:

Instruct students to choose one of the following deployment scenarios for their Corda network setup:
Local development network (for learning and testing).
Consortium network (for a group of trusted participants).
Public Corda network (e.g., Corda Network, for broader access).
Setup Documentation:

Have students document the step-by-step process of setting up a Corda network for their chosen scenario. Include details on hardware and software requirements.
Configuration and Network Parameters:

Provide instructions on configuring network parameters, such as notary selection strategies, network map services, and transaction confirmation rules. Explain how these configurations align with the chosen deployment scenario.
Node Registration:

Describe the process of registering Corda nodes on the network. Explain the roles of different types of nodes (e.g., Notary nodes, Regular nodes) and how they are registered.
Security Measures:

Highlight security measures that should be implemented during network setup to ensure the privacy and integrity of data and transactions.
Testing and Validation:

Instruct students to perform testing and validation steps to ensure that the network is functioning correctly according to the chosen scenario. Include instructions for creating and testing transactions.
Documentation and Reporting:

Students should create detailed documentation of their Corda network setup, including configuration files, node registration records, and any relevant scripts used.
Submission:

Students should submit their documentation and a report summarizing the network setup process and any challenges encountered.
Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Accurate and comprehensive documentation of the Corda network setup process.
Clear instructions for configuring network parameters, registering nodes, and implementing security measures.
Effective testing and validation of the network to ensure functionality.
Quality of documentation and adherence to submission guidelines.
