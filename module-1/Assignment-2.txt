Exploring Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)

Objective: Familiarize students with the fundamental concepts of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and its relevance to Corda.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will delve into the foundational concepts of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and understand its importance in the context of Corda. The objective is to equip students with a clear understanding of DLT, its distinctions from traditional databases, and the various consensus mechanisms that underpin DLT systems, including their impact on trust and security.

Instructions:

Introduction to DLT:

Provide students with an introduction to distributed ledger technology (DLT) as a foundational concept in blockchain and its relevance to Corda.
Differences from Traditional Databases:

Instruct students to research and explain how DLT differs from traditional databases. They should highlight key distinctions, such as decentralization, immutability, and consensus mechanisms.
Consensus Mechanisms in DLT:

Explore various consensus mechanisms used in DLT systems (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Raft, BFT) and their implications for trust and security.
Ask students to select at least one consensus mechanism and provide a detailed explanation of how it works, including its advantages and limitations.
Comparison of Consensus Mechanisms:

Encourage students to compare and contrast different consensus mechanisms, discussing factors such as energy efficiency, scalability, and security.
Discuss the relevance of different consensus mechanisms in various DLT applications.
Real-World Examples:

Provide real-world examples of DLT applications beyond Corda, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, to illustrate the practical implications of consensus mechanisms.
Presentation or Report:

Students can choose to present their findings in a presentation format or compile them into a report. They should use clear explanations, diagrams, and examples to enhance their presentation/report.
Discussion:

After completing their assignment, facilitate a class discussion where students can share their research findings, insights on consensus mechanisms, and their impact on DLT.
Submission:

Students should submit their presentation slides or the report summarizing their research on DLT and consensus mechanisms.
Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Clarity and depth of explanations regarding DLT's differences from traditional databases.
Thorough understanding and explanation of at least one consensus mechanism.
Thoughtful comparison of consensus mechanisms and their practical implications.
Effective presentation or report that communicates findings clearly.
Active participation in the class discussion and engagement with peers.
Overall quality of the assignment and adherence to submission guidelines.
