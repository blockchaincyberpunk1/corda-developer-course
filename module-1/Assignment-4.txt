Corda vs. Other Blockchain Platforms

Objective: Compare Corda with other blockchain platforms to understand its unique characteristics.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will perform a comparative analysis between the Corda blockchain platform and two other prominent blockchain platforms of their choice (e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric). The objective is to help students gain a deeper understanding of Corda's unique characteristics by contrasting it with other platforms. Students will create a comparative analysis chart that highlights the differences and similarities between Corda and the selected platforms in terms of architecture, consensus mechanisms, and use cases.

Instructions:

Introduction to Comparative Analysis:

Provide students with an introduction to the purpose of comparative analysis in understanding the unique features of blockchain platforms like Corda.
Select Two Other Blockchain Platforms:

Instruct students to choose at least two other prominent blockchain platforms. They can select platforms like Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Binance Smart Chain, or others based on their interest.
Research and Gather Information:

Ask students to research and gather information about the selected blockchain platforms. They should focus on the following aspects:
Architecture: Explain the architectural design of each platform, including the components and layers.
Consensus Mechanisms: Describe the consensus mechanisms employed by each platform and their implications.
Use Cases: Identify notable use cases or industries where each platform is commonly applied.
Create a Comparative Analysis Chart:

Require students to create a comparative analysis chart or table that summarizes the differences and similarities between Corda and the selected platforms. The chart should include columns for architecture, consensus mechanisms, and use cases.
Highlight Key Distinctions:

Instruct students to highlight key distinctions and unique characteristics of Corda that set it apart from the other platforms.
Include Real-World Examples:

Encourage students to provide real-world examples or case studies for each platform to illustrate their application in practice.
Presentation or Report:

Students can choose to present their comparative analysis in a presentation format or compile it into a report. They should use clear tables, bullet points, and explanations to enhance their presentation/report.
Discussion:

After completing their assignment, facilitate a class discussion where students can share their comparative analysis findings and insights. Encourage questions and discussions to deepen understanding.
Submission:

Students should submit their presentation slides or the report containing the comparative analysis.
Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Clarity and completeness of the comparative analysis chart.
Quality of explanations regarding architectural differences and consensus mechanisms.
Inclusion of real-world examples and case studies.
Effective presentation or report that communicates findings clearly.
Active participation in the class discussion and engagement with peers.
Overall quality of the assignment and adherence to submission guidelines.
